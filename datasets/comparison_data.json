Give your response in this format:\n(1) Price Movement, which should be either Positive or Negative.\n(2) Explanation, which should be in a single, short paragraph.\nHere are some examples:\nFacts:\n2016-07-26\nApple reported Q3 2016 earnings: Revenue of $42.4 billion, beating expectations. They sold 40.4 million iPhones, 9.9 million iPads, and 4.2 million Macs during that quarter.\nApple's earnings beat expectations, causing the stock to rise by almost 5% in after-hours trading.\nApple had $231.5 billion in cash reserves, enough to potentially acquire companies like Uber, Tesla, Twitter, Airbnb, Netflix, Snapchat, and SpaceX and still have billions left.\nApple's China sales were down around 29% sequentially and 33% YoY.\nDespite declining unit sales, Apple's revenue was boosted by more expensive iPad Pro models.\nApple Pay accounted for 3/4 of contactless payments in the US.\nApple's services business (App Store, Apple Music, etc.) was projected to be the size of a Fortune 500 company in the next year.\nApple was reported to be working on a car project called Project Titan, with Bob Mansfield leading it.\nThe Apple Pencil was granted a patent to work with a Mac's trackpad.\nApple faced declining iPhone sales, but the company focused on promoting apps and services.\nThe stock price experienced fluctuations after the earnings report, with significant after-hours gains.\nApple's market weight rating was reiterated by Wells Fargo, with a target price of $120.00.\n\nPrice Movement: Positive\n\nExplanation: Apple reported strong Q3 2016 earnings, surpassing revenue expectations and delivering robust sales figures across its product lines, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs. This performance exceeded market projections and triggered a nearly 5% increase in the stock's after-hours trading. Additionally, Apple's substantial cash reserves of $231.5 billion, capable of facilitating major acquisitions, demonstrated the company's financial stability and growth potential. Despite challenges in China, Apple's diverse revenue sources, including higher-priced iPad Pro models and the dominant Apple Pay in US contactless payments, contributed positively to its overall Price Movement. The promising growth trajectory of Apple's services business added further optimism. While facing declining iPhone sales, Apple's strategic focus on promoting apps and services reflected adaptability in response to changing market dynamics. The consistent support from Wells Fargo with a reiterated market weight rating and target price also reinforced investor confidence. The stock's fluctuations were notable but aligned with the positive earnings report, showcasing the market's responsiveness to Apple's performance.\n\nFacts:\n2016-04-26\nApple reported its Q2 2016 earnings, missing both profit and revenue estimates.\nApple's revenue for the quarter was $50.56 billion, falling short of the estimated $52 billion.\nThe company's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) was $1.90, lower than the expected $2.00.\nThis marks the first time in 13 years that Apple experienced a quarterly decline in revenue.\niPhone sales experienced a decline for the first time since its debut in 2007.\nThe company's guidance for the next quarter indicates expected sales of $41 billion to $43 billion.\nApple's dividend yield increased to 2.3%.\nCEO Tim Cook attributed the challenges to strong macroeconomic headwinds, especially in China.\nDespite the earnings miss, Apple announced plans to raise its dividend and return $50 billion more to shareholders.\nApple's stock price experienced a decline of around 4.8% in after-hours trading following the earnings report.\n\nPrice Movement: Negative\n\nExplanation: Apple reported disappointing Q2 2016 earnings, missing both profit and revenue estimates. The company's revenue and adjusted earnings per share fell short of expectations, marking the first quarterly revenue decline in 13 years. iPhone sales, a cornerstone of Apple's business, experienced their first-ever decline since the product's debut in 2007. The weaker-than-expected guidance for the next quarter further dampened investor Price Movement. The CEO's acknowledgment of strong macroeconomic headwinds, particularly in China, indicated external challenges affecting the company's performance. Despite announcing plans to increase dividends and return more to shareholders, the stock price plunged around 4.8% in after-hours trading following the earnings report. Overall, these factors collectively indicate a negative Price Movement surrounding AAPL stock due to its underwhelming financial performance and market outlook.\n\n(END OF
